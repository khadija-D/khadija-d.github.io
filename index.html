    <h1 style="color:blue;"> Claim</h1>
    <p>I believe that inside the box is a system of tubes where some water comes out of the nozzle, while the remaining water is stored somewhere.</p>
    <h1 style="color:blue;"> Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box where water comes in and out, but we cannot see the inside of the box. When you put water in the funnel, the same amount of water doesn’t always come out. Sometimes when you put a lot, a little comes out and vice versa. In one trial with the mystery black box 500ml went in and 0 came out, in another 500ml went in and 1915ml came out. To figure out how the mystery box works, we built a model of what we think the inside looks like. In our model there was a tube that led from the funnel directly to the nozzle. There was also another tube that connected the main tube to a cup on the side and one that led from the cup to the nozzle. The idea was that some water would go directly from the funnel to the tube, and some would diverge to the cup, but when the cup filled up it would empty the water to the tube that connected the cup to the nozzle. We tested our model by pouring water through the top and viewing the way the water moved throughout the system. In one trial we put in 250 ml of water and 150 came out. In all of our trials, less water always came out than what went in. So in summary, our design could not be what the inside of the mystery black box looks like, but water is being stored somewhere. </p>
    <h1 style="color:blue;"> Reasoning</h1>
    <h3>Part I</h3>
    <p>A model is a physical representation of a structure. They help you guage the mechanics of something on a smaller scale. Although, they can be limited because of materials and size. They are usually simpler than the original structure.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;"> Part II</h3>
    <p>My evidence shows that my model isn’t exactly what the inside of the mystery black box looks like. However, it also proves that water has to be stored somewhere in the mystery balck box. In our model, some of the water would diverge to the cup and stay there, making less water come out of the nozzle, just like inside of the mystery black box.</p>
    <h3>Part III</h3>
    <p>If the same amount of water that went in always came out, then this would prove that water was not being stored somewhere. If this was true, then if 500 ml went in, 500ml would come out.</p>
